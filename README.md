# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch is a simple web application that allows you to draw on a re-scalable canvas using a mouse. 

## Self-Reflection

This was a very fun project! I opted to use CSS Grid to create the canvas, which I had very little knowledge of going in but now I have a stronger foundation. The biggest challenge was definitely implementing the "new grid" functionality that creates a new grid of variable squares within the same area.
